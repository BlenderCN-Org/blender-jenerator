# Blender Jenerator
A [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) plug-in for generating and setting up things quickly.

## As of this commit, the addon can do the following:
* Create Low-Poly Bricks
* Create Particle Settings for plants and plant-like particles

## Things that need to be worked on/added:
* Turnabout Cameras
* Toon Material generator for Internal, Eevee and Cycles
* Quick Toon outlines (inverted hull technique)
* Turn bones into soft body versions for simple cloth-like animation
* Add extra settings to the particle maker to make the particles have specific objects like trees
* Documentation XD
* And more!
