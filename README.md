# Blender Jenerator
A [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) plug-in for generating and setting up things quickly.

## PLEASE NOTE
Blender Internal is being removed from Blender 2.8 and onwards. Therefore, I will try to adapt the Toon Material to Eevee and Cycles before working on other parts.

## As of this commit, the addon can do the following:
* Create Low-Poly Bricks
* Create Particle Settings for plants and plant-like particles
* Toon Material generator for Cycles (and maybe Eevee)

## Things that need to be worked on/added:
* Turnabout Cameras
* Toon Material generator for Internal
* Quick Toon outlines (inverted hull technique)
* Toon Material for Cycles needs to not emit light, easy enough to fix but I don't have time today
* Turn bones into soft body versions for simple cloth-like animation
* Add extra settings to the particle maker to make the particles have specific objects like trees
* Documentation XD
* And more!
